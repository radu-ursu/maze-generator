## What makes a maze difficult?

- Complexity of the path
- Number of dead ends
- Length of the solution path
- Branching factor (number of choices at each junction)
- Visual complexity (how visually confusing the maze is)
- Symmetry and patterns that can mislead the solver
- Size of the maze (larger mazes can be more challenging)

1. Solution path length -> solPathLength x solPathLengthWeight
2. Number of dead ends -> numDeadEnds x numDeadEndsWeight
3. Branching factor -> branchingFactor x branchingFactorWeight.
